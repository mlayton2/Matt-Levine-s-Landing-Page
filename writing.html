        <h2>The Style</h2>

        <p>
          The New York Times described his writing as mixing "technical elucidation and wit" in a "deadpan style." His prose is bouncy. There are no specific jokes, but the whole text reads humorously.
        </p>

        <p>
          Levine frequently uses hypothetical dialogues, footnotes, and asides to explain complex concepts. He reframes industry jargon in plain language without losing accuracy.
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
          "What I can do is write something that rings true to the specialists and is accurate but that reframes and conceptualizes it in a way where people who do it can be like, 'I didn't think about it that way because I'm in the weeds of it.'"
        </p>

        <h2>Topics</h2>

        <p>
          Recurring themes include: mergers and acquisitions, securities fraud, market structure, cryptocurrency, corporate governance, SPACs, meme stocks, bank regulation, and the ongoing drama of Wall Street.
        </p>

        <p>
          His coverage tends to follow the news cycle. In 2020, crypto dominated. In 2022, Elon Musk's Twitter acquisition. In 2023, Silicon Valley Bank. He finds the thread that connects current events to deeper patterns in finance.
        </p>

        <h2>Notable Works</h2>

        <p>
          Beyond Money Stuff, Levine's notable pieces include:
        </p>

        <p>
          His explainer on JPMorgan's $8 billion "London Whale" loss was featured in the Columbia Journalism Review's annual anthology of the best business writing.
        </p>

        <p>
          "The Crypto Story" for Bloomberg Businessweek in October 2022 was a 40,000-word cover-to-cover issue explaining cryptocurrency.
        </p>

        <h2>Publications</h2>

        <p>
          Beyond Bloomberg, Levine has contributed to The Wall Street Journal, CNN, The Billfold, and the Planet Money blog.
        </p>

        <h2>A Controversy</h2>

        <p>
          In 2015, Levine wrote a column suggesting John Paulson's gift to Harvard should have gone to "literally any other charity." Paulson personally called Michael Bloomberg, who reportedly threatened to shutter Bloomberg's op-ed section. Bloomberg calmed down over the weekend and retracted the threat.
