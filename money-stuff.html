          Money Stuff is Matt Levine's daily newsletter for Bloomberg, published every weekday since February 2015. It began as a simple email version of his blog posts and has grown into one of the most-read finance newsletters in the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          With over 300,000 subscribers, the newsletter has become essential reading for finance professionals, lawyers, tech workers, and anyone curious about how money actually works.
        </p>

        <h2>The Format</h2>

        <p>
          Each edition follows a familiar rhythm: Levine plucks five or so financial news headlines and analyzes them through hypothetical conversations, neologisms, footnotes, and snarky asides. The prose is bouncy. There are no specific jokes, but the whole text reads humorously.
        </p>

        <p>
          It reads like a hurried bar conversation mixed with a caring high school lecture.
        </p>

        <h2>The Topics</h2>

        <p>
          The newsletter covers whatever is happening in finance. In 2020, it was crypto every few days. In 2022, Elon Musk's Twitter acquisition dominated. In 2023, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. The through line is Levine's ability to find the interesting angle in any story.
        </p>

        <p>
          Recurring themes include: mergers and acquisitions, securities fraud, market structure, cryptocurrency, corporate governance, and the eternal question of what banks actually do.
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
          "I describe crypto as 'an incredible writing exercise' because it is new enough that I can quickly get readers up to speed but established enough to mimic ancient financial patterns."
