          Matt Levine is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering finance, Wall Street, and the peculiar ways people find to make and lose money. His writing has been described by The New York Times as mixing "technical elucidation and wit" in a "deadpan style."
        </p>

        <p>
          He makes complex financial concepts accessible to readers who aren't experts while remaining relevant to industry insiders. His ability to find humor in the often absurd world of finance has earned him a devoted following of over 300,000 newsletter subscribers.

        <h2>Education</h2>

        <p>
          Levine graduated from Syosset High School on Long Island, then attended Harvard College, where he studied Classics and graduated with the highest GPA in his class of 2000. He later earned his J.D. from Yale Law School in 2004.
        </p>

        <p>
          His background in Classics might seem unusual for a finance writer, but it informs his approach: finding the ancient patterns that repeat in modern markets, and explaining them with clarity and wit.
        </p>

        <h2>Personal</h2>

        <p>
          He met his wife, Sarah J. Baumgartel, while both were clerking for federal judges in Philadelphia. She was in the same Yale Law class of 2004.

        <p class="quote">
          "I'm never going to be the guy who knows the most details about litigation or finance. What I can do is write something that rings true to the specialists and is accurate but that reframes and conceptualizes it in a way where people who do it can be like, 'I didn't think about it that way because I'm in the weeds of it.'"
