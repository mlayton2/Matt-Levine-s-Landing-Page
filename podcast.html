        <p>
          Once a week, Matt Levine and Katie Greifeld sit down to talk about Wall Street, finance, and other stuff. New episodes are released every Friday.
        </p>

        <h2>The Format</h2>

        <p>
          Katie Greifeld is a Bloomberg News reporter and TV host. The podcast extends the conversational style of the newsletter into an actual conversation. Topics range from the week's biggest finance news to the weird corners of markets that Levine finds interesting.
        </p>

        <h2>The Tone</h2>

        <p>
          Like the newsletter, the podcast manages to be both informative and entertaining. Levine's tendency to find the absurd angle in serious financial news translates well to audio format.
        </p>

        <p>
          The podcast is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and wherever you get your podcasts.
        </p>

        <h2>Notable Episodes</h2>

        <p>
          The show frequently covers the same themes as Money Stuff: crypto drama, corporate governance fights, securities enforcement, and the ongoing question of what exactly banks do and whether they should be allowed to do it.
