        <p>
          In October 2022, Bloomberg Businessweek published an entire issue written by a single author: Matt Levine. The result was a 40,000-word essay called "The Crypto Story."
        </p>

        <p>
          It was only the second time in Bloomberg Businessweek's 93-year history that an entire issue was devoted to one story by one writer. The first was Paul Ford's "What Is Code?" in 2015.
        </p>

        <h2>The Work</h2>

        <p>
          The essay attempts to explain where crypto came from, what it all means, and why it still matters. Mirroring Levine's signature style, the piece features many footnotes throughout. The online interactive version allows readers to jump between chapters.
        </p>

        <p>
          Editor Joel Weber called Levine "the finest finance writer around" when announcing the special issue.
        </p>

        <h2>The Timing</h2>

        <p>
          The piece was published just weeks before the collapse of FTX. In a strange twist of fate, Levine had interviewed Sam Bankman-Fried months earlier on a podcast, where he made a now-famous observation.
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
          "You're just like, well, I'm in the Ponzi business and it's pretty good."
        </p>

        <p>
          This quote became widely shared after FTX's implosion, seen by many as prescient. Levine was describing yield farming, but the broader point about crypto's recursive nature proved apt.
        </p>

        <h2>The Approach</h2>

        <p>
          Levine has been described as "a fair and open-minded member of the financial press, with superfine establishment credentials as a lawyer and a former investment banker, and a lively, bouncy style of writing."
        </p>

        <p>
          The Crypto Story embodies this: neither a cheerleader nor a skeptic, but someone trying to understand and explain.
